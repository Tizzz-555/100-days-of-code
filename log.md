### Day 5: November 8, Wednesday

🔸 Found out how to make a custom post type in WP. Drew a note explaining up two of the functions I found in the codebase.

### Day 6: November 9, Thursday

🔸 Today I learned how to upload images to #WordPress backend in a form using enctype="multipart/form-data". I handled file inputs with $_FILES in PHP, and used AJAX to communicate with the designated endpoint.

🔸 Now #GitHubUniverse day 2!

### Day 7: November 10, Friday

🔸 ... Today I honestly just spent a lot of time debugging the code I had written yesterday to handle images submission, to some success. 😅 

🔸 I need to kick back imposter syndrome, relax and casually work on some of my weekend personal projects. 🦾

### Day 8: November 11, Saturday

🔸 Wrote more code for my Twitter custom client.

@NoBoilerplate on the topic.

[Tweet link](https://x.com/beccari_mattia/status/1723415360890712233?s=20)

### Day 9: November 12, Sunday

🔸 I cleaned up the logic of my script so that it could handle the difference between a text only tweet and one with an image a bit more gracefully.

🔸 Then I started a simple #Flask server and designed a minimal first draft for my app's client.

### Day 10: November 13, Monday

🔸 Added a script to my X app, and practiced again with FormData and AJAX. I can now post text from my client,  adding images is buggy tho.

🔸 I dug deeper into the FormData object and got to write some notes on Obsidian about it, so that it sticks! ✍️

### Day 11: November 14, Tuesday

🔸 I learned about @LeafletJS, setting up the map and tiles was pretty easy, but I got stuck figuring out how to use geolocalization by street name input instead of the default coordinates system.

🔸 Tomorrow will sort it out 🦾

**Link(s) to work**
[Tweet link](https://x.com/beccari_mattia/status/1724519331973714127?s=20)

### Day 12: November 15, Wednesday

🔸 With the right plugin and a little javascript I could add the geocoding I was looking for. 

🔸 The next step would be having the marker draggable and reverse geocoding to the input so that the user making a report can be as specific as possible.

### Day 14: November 17, Friday

🔸 More Leaflet poking around! Today I tried to populate an input field inside my form with the value I was inserting into the map's geocoding search box. 🌎

🔸 I wanted it to bind two way, but I only managed to do one way so far (search box to input). 🔍

### Day 15: November 18, Saturday

🔸 I've improved the frontend of my app with attachment preview.

🔸 I need to change things around quite a bit still, especially in the html, right now it looks pretty janky, tomorrow will improve it. 🦾

### Day 16: November 19, Sunday

🔸 I cleaned up the frontend a bit, it now looks functional enough to be used.

### Day 17: November 20, Monday

🔸 Finally integrated geocoder into leaflet the way I wanted:

🔸Initialised the geocoding provider directly 

🔸Used its geocode() method to populate the variable used to update the map and marker.

🔸 This entire Leflet thing was a very good exercise to learn more about geolocal and how to approach challenging documentation

### Day 18: November 21, Tuesday

🔸 Added a bit of logic to my tweepy app to limit the file upload to only 4 pictures 

🔸 It deactivates the button after you reach 4 and throws an alert if you try to upload more by selecting multiple files

### Day 22: November 25, Saturday

🔸 Wrote a lot more CSS, this thing is slowly starting to look nice!

### Day 56: December 29, Friday

🔸 Worked a bit more on the FCC documentation project, wrote most of the markup, now I need CSS.

### Day 57: December 30, Saturday

🔸 Syntax highlighting could be done only with libraries such as highlight.js, so it is not really possible in the context of FCC. 

🔸 I then created single line spans each filled with more spans and styled the syntax individually
