### Day 5: November 8, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Found out how to make a custom post type in WP. Drew a note explaining up two of the functions I found in the codebase.  

**Thoughts** Attended day 1 of #GitHubUniverse virtually. Copilot chat looks awesome, especially some of the out of IDE stuff. ü§Ø

### Day 6: November 9, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned how to upload images to #WordPress backend in a form using enctype="multipart/form-data". I handled file inputs with $_FILES in PHP, and used AJAX to communicate with the designated endpoint.

### Day 7: November 10, Friday

**Today's Progress**: ... Today I honestly just spent a lot of time debugging the code I had written yesterday to handle images submission, to some success. üòÖ 

**Thoughts** I need to kick back imposter syndrome, relax and casually work on some of my weekend personal projects. ü¶æ

### Day 8: November 11, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Wrote more code for my Twitter custom client.

**Thoughts** Today I watched and read more stuff on how to better use #Obsidan, and I especially enjoyed a Youtube video from 
@NoBoilerplate on the topic.

### Day 9: November 12, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I cleaned up the logic of my script so that it could handle the difference between a text only tweet and one with an image a bit more gracefully.

**Thoughts** Then I started a simple #Flask server and designed a minimal first draft for my app's client.

### Day 10: November 13, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Added a script to my X app, and practiced again with FormData and AJAX. I can now post text from my client,  adding images is buggy tho.

**Thoughts** I dug deeper into the FormData object and got to write some notes on Obsidian about it, so that it sticks! ‚úçÔ∏è

### Day 11: November 14, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about @LeafletJS, setting up the map and tiles was pretty easy, but I got stuck figuring out how to use geolocalization by street name input instead of the default coordinates system.

**Thoughts** Tomorrow will sort it out ü¶æ

**Link(s) to work**
[Tweet link](https://x.com/beccari_mattia/status/1724519331973714127?s=20)

### Day 12: November 15, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: With the right plugin and a little javascript I could add the geocoding I was looking for. 

**Thoughts** The next step would be having the marker draggable and reverse geocoding to the input so that the user making a report can be as specific as possible.

### Day 14: November 17, Friday

**Today's Progress**: More Leaflet poking around! Today I tried to populate an input field inside my form with the value I was inserting into the map's geocoding search box. üåé

**Thoughts** I wanted it to bind two way, but I only managed to do one way so far (search box to input). üîç

### Day 15: November 18, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've improved the frontend of my app with attachment preview.

**Thoughts** I need to change things around quite a bit still, especially in the html, right now it looks pretty janky, tomorrow will improve it. ü¶æ

### Day 16: November 19, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I cleaned up the frontend a bit, it now looks functional enough to be used.   

**Thoughts** I will polish it more along the way, but it is already a lot better than yesterday

### Day 17: November 20, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finally integrated geocoder into leaflet the way I wanted:

üî∏Initialised the geocoding provider directly 

üî∏Used its geocode() method to populate the variable used to update the map and marker.

**Thoughts** This entire Leflet thing was a very good exercise to learn more about geolocal and how to approach challenging documentation

### Day 18: November 21, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Added a bit of logic to my tweepy app to limit the file upload to only 4 pictures 

**Thoughts** It deactivates the button after you reach 4 and throws an alert if you try to upload more by selecting multiple files

### Day 20: November 23, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Added multiple files upload functionality.  request.files.getlist('media') in Flask allowed me to properly retrieve the files without needing to construct different keys for each of them

**Thoughts** Coded at 9 pm after running my Thursday's after work 10k... That's dedication, so bravo me. Tomorrow will add a few finishing touches

### Day 22: November 25, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a lot more CSS, this thing is slowly starting to look nice!

**Thoughts**: CSS can be funnier than I often thought, it's something I never really dug into that much, but this "cloning" thing is pretty cool
